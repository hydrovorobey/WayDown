*Usage of the package:*
- download and last release of the package from GitHub
- install package and required libs:
  
   install.packages('copula')
   install.packages('markovchain')
   install.packages("path_to_package/WayDown/", repos=NULL, type="source")

- load daily (data to disaggregate) and sub-daily (e.g. 1 min, 10 min measured data) precipitation in workspace (data must be provided in specified format, see example)
- select required parameters for convergence and max iteration number
- run the WayDown function - it returns a dataframe with disaggregated time-series

*Technical remarks*:
- package was tested under R (versions 3.6.0 and 4.2.2)
- following libs are required: copula (>= 1.0-1), markovchain (>= 0.8.5-4), lubridate (>= 1.7.10)
- input data requirements: 
    - no missing values are allowed in daily data
    - missing values are allowed in sub-daily data, but the model will freeze/crash if at least few full days with precipitation events (without NAs) will not be found for each month

*Publications*:
- Simulating sub-hourly rainfall data for current and future periods using two statistical disaggregation models â€“ case studies from Germany and South Korea
